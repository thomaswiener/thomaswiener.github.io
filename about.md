    <i>Your expert in Agile Software Engineering</i>
</p>

I am a freelance php expert, with more than 8 years of experience in software development and 2 years particularly in symfony2.
As a former CTO and lead developer of several startups in Berlin I am widely experienced in architecture, test driven
development and continuous integration solutions.

My priorities are:

* [symfony2](http://symfony.com)
* [capifony](http://capifony.org)
* [jenkins/ci](http://jenkins-ci.org)
* [cakephp](http://cakephp.org)
* [magento](http://magento.com
* phpunit
* tdd
* architecture

If you are in need of a lead developer and/or consultant for your IT to optimize processes and accelerate your development
